## Getting Started

This repository serves as the foundation for all ZimmZimmGames web pages. You can use this main page as a showcase for your current game in development.  Additionally, you can easily create forks of this repository to establish dedicated pages for multiple games, particularly those in active development or with a large player base. This allows you to have independent pages for each game while maintaining a consistent structure and design.

To create a new page for a game:
1. Fork this repository.
2. Customize the content for the new game.
3. Deploy the new page.

More detailed instructions will be added soon.

For now, this repository is the foundation for all ZimmZimmGames web pages.
